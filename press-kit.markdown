## What is Taylor's Version

In 2021, Taylor Swift began to release re-recordings of her first six albums. Read more at [Taylor Swift Masters Controversy on Wikipedia &raquo;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_masters_controversy)

_Taylor's Version_ is an iOS app that scans your Spotify library and helps you replace Taylor Swift songs in your playlists with the new, re-recorded versions. Alongside this, it generates easily-shareable stats for you about how many Taylor Swift songs you have in your library, and notifications for when new re-recordings become available.

_Taylor's Version_ is a free download with a one-time in-app purchase to unlock extra features.

### A note on Apple Music

Currently, _Taylor's Version_ only works with Spotify because Apple Music doesn't allow third-party apps to remove songs from playlists. I'd love to add Apple Music support in the future if this situation changes.

## What's the story behind it?

Iâ€™m [Shaun](https://twitter.com/shauneba), an indie iOS developer in London, UK. I'm a huge Swiftie and I found that I had lots of now re-recorded songs hanging around my playlists that I wanted to replace. Instead of spending ten minutes doing this, I decided to spend two months of evenings and weekends building an app to do it.

I really liked the idea of making a best-in-class, polished iOS app for an niche purpose that most people wouldn't even consider building an app for.

I've put lots of little touches into _Taylor's Version_ that both Swifties, casual fans, and maybe even The Haters will appreciate, like custom app icons, a Taylor Swift quiz, and a button to add a random Taylor Swift song to any of your playlists. My goal was to make something that Taylor herself would enjoy using, and I hope I've achieved that.

## System requirements

_Taylor's Version_ is available for iPhone and iPads running iOS 15.0 or later.
