## Privacy Policy

Taylor's Version doesn't collect any personally-identifiable data. If you choose to connect to Spotify, your account info (profile, playlists and liked songs) will be accessed and will only leave your device in order to communicate back to Spotify, for example to update your playlists when you choose to do so.

The only data collected is anonymous telemetry data, such as model of iPhone and iOS version, and data about which features are being used. This data is collected via [Telemetry Deck](https://telemetrydeck.com).

If you choose to turn on notifications, your device will be anonymously connected to Google's [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com) which handles notifications. [Read more about Firebase's privacy policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).
